# ChatBot

I created this repo for keeping scripts I played or experimented.</br>
Most of code are kept in ".ipynb" to show how each line of code works.</br>
</br>
In this project is assignment for NLP class at NIDA using Retrieval-Based.</br>
Python scripts will be used to create Chatbot question answering.</br>
